    "description": "I am an elementary school teacher who teaches Python to young students. During my classes, I created a small Python package to help students better understand lists and dictionaries in a more engaging way. In this session, I share the process of creating that package, how I used it in my classroom, and a simple method for anyone to build their own mini package. I hope this talk will be helpful to those interested in Python 101 education.\n\nKo Hak-neung\nHello, I am currently working as an elementary school teacher and learning Python together with my students. I'm happy to be presenting at PyCon.KR 2024.",
