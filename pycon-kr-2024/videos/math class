    "description": "While conducting the Python 101 class, I created a small Python package to explain lists and dictionaries in a fun way. This session introduces the process by which 101 participants became interested in the Python 101 class by using the package, my experience, and a simple method for anyone to easily create their own small package. I hope this will be of some help to those who are interested in Python 101 education.\n\nHan Sang-gon\nHello. I am currently working as a Microsoft MVP. I am currently studying programming languages ​​at a university in Busan, and I am also taking Python classes and studying Djanog. Nice to meet you.",
